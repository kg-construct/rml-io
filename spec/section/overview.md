## Overview {#overview}

*This section is non-normative.*

This document specifies *Logical Source* and *Logical Target*, 
Logical Source is a description
for specifying how a data source should be accessed.
A Logical Source description is not limited to a specific Source
which allows to access any type of Source and provides a reference formulation
to refer to data inside the Source.

Logical Target is
a description for defining how a generated 
RDF [[RDF-Concepts]]
knowledge graph must be exported. 
A Logical Target description is not tailored towards a specific Target 
which allows to export the generated RDF triples to any type of Target
and provides fine-grained control over where each RDF triple is exported to.

Logical Source and Logical Target leverage
the access descriptions of data access 
such as DCAT [[DCAT]], SD [[SD]], etc. 

In this document, examples assume 
the following namespace prefix bindings unless otherwise stated:
