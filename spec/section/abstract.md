## Abstract {#abstract}

This document describes *Logical Source* and *Logical Target*
to access data sources and targets.

A *Logical Source* is a formal model and common representation
for describing access to data sources.
A *Logical Target* is
a formal model and a common representation
for specifying how a Knowledge Graph should be exported to a given target.

Logical Source and Logical Target reuses existing data access descriptions
and is therefore not limited to a specific set of targets or data sources.
The current document describes the Logical Source and Logical Target concepts
through definitions and examples.

The version of this document is *DRAFT*.
